    <p>One of the most important thing's I value would be Turtles as I used to have a very samll pet turtle. I still like turtle's until this day and they are my favorite animal. Some facts about turtles are that Turtles have a second shell as well as them not being as silent as we think. </p>

<div class="P2">
  <p>Beans are my favortie food I eat them with everything it could be with eggs, rice and much more. Beans are also very helthy for you as well as taste extremlly good. There are many types of Beans and I encourage you to try all of them as all of them taste good. </p>

<div class="P3">
  <p>Houses should be liked by everyone there a great way to beat inflation as the price of your house goes up every year so you can sell it if you want to. If you don't want to sell your house you can live in it and design it as you please a house is like your own personality as you would put what items you would want it.</p>
