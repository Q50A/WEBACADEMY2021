  <p>The job that I am looking to work for is a job that involves computers. THe reason I want to work with computers is because I like working with them. If it is coding play games building or maybe even image designing I am intersted in any jobs with computers. ANother reason is because of how I dont have to leave my work station esspiccally if im working from home.   </p>
  <br>
  <p>The college that would be best fit for me would be any college in the city that has a good computer science program. For example like St. Johns it is very close to my house and they have a decent computer program. Another example is Brauch college they have a good computer program. The only reason I want to go there is because they have a nice computer science program. THese are the collegs that I am looking for the most at this time. </p>

  <p>I dont really know much on scholarships. However I plan on applying for as many as I can as I dont want to take a loan. DUring scholarships I have prepared myself by working on essay writing skills and intrvieing skills. this way I can express myself better and get my point acroos easier. Through this I hope I am able to bget a full scholarship and not have to pay for college. This is how I have been preparing for schoarships.</p>
