    <p>The movie Venom is one of my favorite movies because it's a Marvel movie and im a big fan of marvel. Venom is also a very funny movie and has a lot comedy involved within it. Venom is also a very action packed movie it also has as a bit mystery involved. Which makes it extremly addicting to watch. These are the biggest reasons on why venom is one of my favorite movies.</p>
    <p> A reporter who was recently fired from his job encountered an alien of what we call Venom. He lived with the reporter for a while and came to the conclusion the he perfers earth over his home planet. He then helps the reporter with his problems and tells him on how there are other aliens like him trying to destroy this world. They eventually find the others and they fight as Venom wins the fight peace is restored and they continue on ther daily lives.</p>
