    <p style="color:red"> The reason why Avengers Endgame is on of my favorite movies is becase its a Marvel movie. It is also the finaly of the avengers series which makes it even more exciting to watch than any others. Its full of action as it is a continuation of Infinty war we would expect less action but it alll kicks in. It features time travel and even some comedic and mystery moments. This is why Avengers Endgame is one of my favorite movies.</p>
    <p style="color:red"> In Avengers endgame we ahve to start off before and slowly move to after.twenty-three days after Thanos killed half of all life in the universe Iron man and Nebula are rescued from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers. They then look for thanos to use the infity stones to try to restore evrything but realize Thanos destroyed them they then kill him and do nothing for 5 whole years. After 5 years they realize they can go back in time thanks to Antman so they go back in time get the infity stones and return back to there time period howwever they realize Thanos from the past came with them. They then have a fight over them until Tony Stark uses the stones to kill thanos and the Hulk brings the people who died back to life.</p>
