        <p style="color:blue"> The reason why A Silent Voice is one of my favorite movies is because its a slice of life movie. Most people would avoid a slice of life movie but to me there pretty intresting there the movies that contain the most emotion. That is what A Silent Voice does best at it expresses emotion like depression and joyfulness perfectly. Therefore The movie A Silent Voice is one of my favorite movies.</p>
        <p style="color:blue"> A young man is ostracized by his classmates after he bullies a deaf girl to the point where she moves away. Years later, he sets off on a path for redemption. He then goes on to try to reedem himself for what he did in the past however he has a trouble path ahead of him he somehow manages to get passed his troubles and eh makes new friends along the way eventually he is fully forgivered from his bullying and things return to normal.</p>
